Greedy Algoritm:
->used for optimization problems
->problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: 
At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem
->Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques

Used only when:
1. global optimum can be arrived at by selecting the local optimum
2. Optimal solution contains optimal solution to the sub problems

Greedy never reconsiders its options

Divide & Conquer
1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers
 ->Divide and Conquer should be used when same subproblems are not evaluated many times.
