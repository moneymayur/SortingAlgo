Greedy Algoritm:
->used for optimization problems
->problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: 
At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem
->Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques
